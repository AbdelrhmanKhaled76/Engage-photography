Engage Photography
This project is one of my earlier works, developed using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, alongside the Bootstrap framework. The website features a responsive design and utilizes the Owl Carousel library to implement sliders.

At the time of creating this project, I was still learning web design principles. Therefore, I used the Engage website template as the foundation for the design, as they offer excellent templates for inspiration. I also incorporated jQuery to create animations and enhance the user experience.

Key highlights of this project include:

* A fully responsive design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
* Smooth and visually appealing animations.
* Mastery of the Bootstrap grid system for layout management.
* The integration of the Owl Carousel library for sliders.
This project represents an important milestone in my development journey and showcases my growing skills in web development during that time.
